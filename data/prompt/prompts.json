Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. \n Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument \n Option0: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause \n Option1: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution \n Option2: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem \n Option3: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: In the paintings by seventeenth-century Dutch artist Vermeer, we find several recurrent items: a satin jacket, a certain Turkish carpet, and wooden chairs with lion' s head finials. These reappearing objects might seem to evince a dearth of props. Yet we know that many of the props Vermeer used were expensive. Thus, while we might speculate about exactly why Vermeer worked with a small number of familiar objects, it was clearly not for lack of props that the recurrent items were used. \n Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: If a dearth of props accounted for the recurrent objects in Vermeer's paintings, we would not see expensive props in any of them. \n Option1: The props that recur in Vermeer's paintings were always available to him. \n Option2: The satin jacket and wooden chairs that recur in the paintings were owned by Vermeer's sister. \n Option3: The several recurrent items that appeared in Vermeer's paintings had special sentimental importance for him. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: According to a prediction of the not-so-distant future published in 1940, electricity would revolutionize agriculture. Electrodes would be inserted into the soil, and the current between them would kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger. \n Question: Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed? \n Option0: In order for farmers to avoid electric shock while working in the fields, the current could be turned off at such times without diminishing the intended effects. \n Option1: Because a planting machine would need to avoid coming into contact with the electrodes, new parts for planting machines would need to be designed. \n Option2: It cannot be taken for granted that the use of electricity is always beneficial. \n Option3: Since weeds are plants, electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants. \n Answer: The answer is Option3 \n Context: Most people are indignant at the suggestion that they are not reliable authorities about their real wants. Such self-knowledge, however, is not the easiest kind of knowledge to acquire. Indeed, acquiring it often requires hard and even potentially risky work. To avoid such effort, people unconsciously convince themselves that they want what society says they should want. \n Question: The main point of the argument is that \n Option0: people cannot really want what they should want \n Option1: knowledge of what one really wants is not as desirable as it is usually thought to be \n Option2: people are not necessarily reliable authorities about what they really want \n Option3: people usually avoid making difficult decisions \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n", "Context: When a group of people starts a company, the founders usually serve as sources both of funding and of skills in marketing, management, and technical matters. It is unlikely that a single individual can both provide adequate funding and be skilled in marketing, management, and technical matters. Ttherefore, companies founded by groups are more likely to succeed than companies founded by individuals. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? \n Option0: Some founding members of successful companies can provide both funding and skills in marketing, management, or technical matters. \n Option1: Founders of a new company can more easily acquire marketing and management abilities than technical abilities. \n Option2: New companies are more likely to succeed when their founders can provide adequate funding and skills in marketing, management, and technical abilities than if they must secure funding or skills from nonfounders. \n Option3: A new company is more likely to succeed if every founding member contributes equally to the company's initial funding than if some members contribute more funds than others. \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Trustee: The recent exhibit at the art museum was extensively covered by the local media, and this coverage seems to have contributed to the record-breaking attendance it drew. If the attendance at the exhibit had been low, the museum would have gone bankrupt and closed permanently, so the museum could not have remained open had it not been for the coverage from the local media. \n Question: The reasoning in the trustee's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument \n Option0: presupposes the very conclusion that it is trying to prove \n Option1: takes for granted that most people who read articles about the exhibit also attended the exhibit \n Option2: fails to address the possibility that the exhibit would have drawn enough visitors to prevent bankruptcy even without media coverage \n Option3: takes for granted that no previous exhibit at the museum had received such extensive media coverage \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Undoubtedly, one' s freedom is always worth the risk of losing one' s life. Consider a person who is locked in a bare cement room with no hope of escape. This person is not really living and has nothing to lose. \n Question: A flaw in the argument's reasoning is that the argument \n Option0: generalizes inappropriately from a single extreme case to a universal claim \n Option1: presumes, without providing justification, that nothing can have greater value than one's own freedom \n Option2: fails to consider that it is not always possible to rebel physically against an encroachment on one's freedom \n Option3: fails to establish that the freedom of others is worth taking risks for \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: The traditional view of the Roman emperor Caligula as a cruel and insane tyrant has been challenged by some modern historians. They point out that little documentation of Caligula' s alleged cruelty or outrageous behavior survives from the time of his reign and that the histories that have come down to us were written by his enemies. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the challenge from the modem historians? \n Option0: People who have lived under someone regarded as a cruel tyrant are more likely to view that person unfavorably than favorably. \n Option1: The specific outrageous acts attributed to Caligula in Roman documentation are very similar to acts attributed in earlier writings to other rulers alleged to be cruel tyrants. \n Option2: There is less documentation of any sort from Caligula's reign than from the reigns of most other Roman emperors of Caligula's era. \n Option3: There is ample documentation of modern tyrants being responsible for outrageous acts worse than those attributed to Caligula. \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: In Country X' s last election, the Reform Party beat its main opponent, the Conservative Party, although pollsters, employing in-person interviews shortly before the vote, had projected a Conservative Party victory. Afterwards, the pollsters determined that, unlike Conservative Party supporters, Reform Party supporters were less likely to express their party preference during in-person interviews than they were during telephone interviews. Ttherefore, using only telephone interviews instead would likely result in more accurate projections for the next election. \n Question: Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the argument in the passage? \n Option0: For each person interviewed in telephone polls before the next election, pollsters will be able to reasonably determine the likelihood of that person voting. \n Option1: In the next election, pollsters will be able to conduct more in-person interviews than telephone interviews. \n Option2: The number of voters in Country X's next election will be significantly larger than the number of voters in the last election. \n Option3: The Conservative Party will win the next election. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n"]}}, {"name": "subq", "prompt": {"context": [["Buying elaborate screensavers -- programs that put moving images on a computer monitor to prevent damage -- can cost a company far more in employee time than it saves in electricity and monitor protection.

Employees cannot resist spending time playing with screensavers that flash interesting graphics across their screens. \n Question: Why does the fact that an electronic keyboard may be cheaper to buy than a piano but more expensive to repair not closely conform to the principle illustrated above? \n Option0: The expenses relating to potential repairs are not comparable to the expenses related to trade-offs that are certain like the author is referring to. \n Option1: A complicated security system reduces the burden of one problem while increasing the burden of another problem, which is directly comparable to the reducing the burden of energy consumption while increasing the burden of unproductive employees that the author suggests is the result of screensavers. \n Option2: The author is making an argument specifically about trade-offs in two distinct aspects of a particular system, which is unlike merely looking at how a particular system will be beneficial or not over a period of time. \n Option3: The author argues about the productivity of workers being traded for energy consumption, while the duration of cooking dinner versus receiving delivered pizza merely points to how long something may take or how convenient it is. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: Insurance Company X is considering issuing a new policy to cover services required by elderly people who suffer from diseases that afflict the elderly. Premiums for the policy must be low enough to attract customers. Ttherefore, Company X is concerned that the income from the policies would not be sufficient to pay for the claims that would be made. \n Question: What is the reason for Company X not likely to minimize its losses on the policies by insuring only those individuals who were rejected by other companies for similar policies? \n Option0: Most children do not need insurance policies.  Therefore you will not make much of a profit selling to children. \n Option1: If someone was rejected by another company than they are probably for likely to have serious health issues which would make them less profitable to insure. \n Option2: Attracting middle aged customers who are healthier and less likely to file claims would be cheaper and more profitable for the company. \n Option3: A wealthy individual may be more likely to shop around for a better policy and therefore would not give you the income that you are looking for. \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: As many as 98, 000 people die each year due to medical error. In a campaign to reduce lethal errors, thousands of hospitals introduced six key changes, including rapid-response teams, re-checks of patient medication, and new guidelines for preventing infection. The campaign estimated that, over an 18-month period, more than 100, 000 lives were saved as a direct result of the program. \n Question:  What is the basis for inferring that, if the campaign had not been implemented, more than 100,000 people might have died during the 18-month period due to medical error? \n Option0: This assumes the changes saved everyone and will be used in the future, neither of which is supported. \n Option1: This may or may not be true, since adjustments to the changes may occur. \n Option2: If hospitals adopt changes which reduce medical error, fewer fatal medical errors will occur, and without the medical errors, more people would have lived.  \n Option3: If 98, 000 people die each year, and 100,000 lives were saved by the changes, this statement is close, but not entirely accurate.  \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Physician: In itself, exercise does not cause heart attacks; rather, a sudden increase in an exercise regimen can be a cause. When people of any physical condition suddenly increase their amount of exercise, they also increase their risk of heart attack. As a result, there will be an increased risk of heart attack among employees of this company due to the new health program. \n Question: Why does the conclusion not logically follow even if it is assumed that the new health program constitutes a sudden change in the company's policy? \n Option0: The text does not state if this is a sudden change by the company or if they are just changing health programs. Even if it is sudden, the suddenness of the program does not increase risk of heart attack- it is the sudden increase in actual exercise. \n Option1: Even if all the employees participated, the increased risk of heart attack would only happen if they suddenly increase their activity level. If everyone exercised at their current level then participating in the program will not lead to an increased risk of hear attack. \n Option2: If an abrupt increase in exercise will increase the risk of heart attack, then an increase in heart attacks would happen with this new program because people suddenly increases their activity when they joined the program. \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president' s speech as inflammatory and argued that it was ttherefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley' s testimony. Ttherefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president' s speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. \n Question: Why is the argument not considered to be invalid due to its failure to sufficiently consider the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences? \n Option0: The author argues that unless the speech can be proven to be inflammatory it can not be inappropriate but the speech could not be inflammatory yet still be inappropriate in some other way. \n Option1: The author shows that Riley may be biased against the president but they do not state the Riley has anything in particular to gain in this situation. \n Option2: The author argues that Riley's animosity toward the university may cause bias and this would be the case whether the animosity was well founded or not. \n Option3: The author argues for the stance that the speech was likely appropriate, therefore the speech being appropriate for some audiences is in line with their argument.  \n Answer: The answer is Option3 \n", "Context: Ethicist: Studies have documented the capacity of placebos to reduce pain in patients who believe that they are receiving beneficial drugs. Some doctors say that they administer placebos because medically effective treatment reinforced by the placebo effect sometimes helps patients recover faster than good treatment alone. But administering placebos is nonetheless ethically questionable, for even if a placebo benefits a patient, a doctor might, for example, have prescribed it just to give the patient satisfaction that something was being done. \n Question: What is the reasoning that supports the assumption that the motivation for administering a placebo can be relevant to the ethical justification for doing so in the ethicist's argument? \n Option0: None of the above choices \n Option1: The ethicist specifically cites that sometimes, a patient's psychological satisfaction is a consideration in administering medical treatment, so the argument does not rely on an assumption that it is not a consideration. \n Option2: The ethicist states that the ethical questionability of placebo administration arises from the reason that the doctor had for prescribing a placebo, such as wanting to assure the patient that something was being done. \n Option3: The ethicist's conclusion is that administering placebos is ethically questionable, which is not supported by a claim that administering placebos is justified. \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: In the last election, 89 percent of reporters voted for the incumbent. The content of news programs reveals that reporters allowed the personal biases reflected in this voting pattern to affect their news coverage: 54 percent of coverage concerning the challenger was negative, compared with only 30 percent of that concerning the incumbent. \n Question: Why is the argument not logically flawed for disregarding the possibility that reporters generally fear losing access to incumbents more than they fear losing access to challengers? \n Option0: It actually supports the probability that they fear losing access to incumbents more. \n Option1: The electorate's voting behavior does not affect the arguments logic. \n Option2: There could be actual news that supports the reporters views regardless of their biases. \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: The problem that environmental economics aims to remedy is the following: people making economic decisions cannot readily compare environmental factors, such as clean air and the survival of endangered species, with other costs and benefits. As environmental economists recognize, solving this problem requires assigning monetary values to environmental factors. But monetary values result from people comparing costs and benefits in order to arrive at economic decisions. Thus, environmental economics is stymied by what motivates it. \n Question: Why is the passage's conclusion not strongly supported even if economic decision-making has not yet had any effect on the things categorized as environmental factors? \n Option0: None of the above choices \n Option1: The author is not using a circular argument that takes the conclusion as one of its premises. \n Option2: The passage indicates that economic decision-making does have an effect on  environmental factors \n Option3: The assumption that monetary values for environmental factors cannot be assigned unless people make economic decisions about these factors is supported by the author's assertions. \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Magazine article: Punishment for crimes is justified if it actually deters people from committing them. But a great deal of carefully assembled and analyzed empirical data show clearly that punishment is not a deterrent. So punishment is never justified. \n Question: Why is the reasoning in the magazine article's argument not considered to be invalid due to its failure to address the issue of mistakenly punishing the innocent? \n Option0: None of the above choices \n Option1: It does not ignore the problem of mistakenly punishing the innocent because it says no punishment is ever justified. \n Option2: The reasoning in the article is not precise at all; it is very generalized. \n Option3: The article does not shift the meaning of \"punishment\".  \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: Politician: We should impose a tariff on imported fruit to make it cost consumers more than domestic fruit. Otherwise, growers from other countries who can grow better fruit more cheaply will put domestic fruit growers out of business. This will result in farmland' s being converted to more lucrative industrial uses and the consequent vanishing of a unique way of life. \n Question: Why does the politician's recommendation not closely conform to the principle that a country should put the interests of its own citizens ahead of those of citizens of other countries? \n Option0: The politician acknowledges that the recommended government intervention actually prevents creation of economic efficiency compared to allowing fully free markets. \n Option1: The politician's recommendation does focus on the interests of its own citizens at the expense of foreign citizens, but it does not necessarily mean that this prioritization always applies. \n Option2: The politician acknowledges that domestic fruit growers going out of business would result in more lucrative and efficient industrial opportunities, but frames this as an undesirable outcome because of the social problems that would result in the form of damage to traditional ways of life. \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n", "Context: On the first day of the course, a philosophy professor told the class that no student has ever earned an A without reading all of the mandatory books. Jorge read all of the mandatory books and suggested course materials for his philosophy course. Ttherefore, Jorge will earn an A in his philosophy course. \n Question: What evidence is there that the argument does not commit the mistake of confusing probability and certainty? \n Option0: Correlation and causation is not applicable here, as it does not state that all students that read the course work get an A. \n Option1: There is no relative or absolute condition in the passage. \n Option2: There is no mention of probability related to reading of coursework in the passage, rather it is a requirement to have a chance at getting an A. \n Option3: It is necessary to read all the course material to get an A, but it is not sufficient enough of a condition to guarantee an A. \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Environmentalist: An increased number of oil spills and the consequent damage to the environment indicate the need for stricter safety standards for the oil industry. Since the industry refuses to take action, it is the national government that must regulate industry safety standards. In particular, the government has to at least require oil companies to put double hulls on their tankers and to assume financial responsibility for accidents. Industry representative: The industry alone should be responsible for devising safety standards because of its expertise in handling oil and its understanding of the cost entailed. Implementing the double-hull proposal is not currently feasible because it creates new safety issues. Furthermore, the cost would be burdensome to the industry and consumers. \n Question:  What is the reasoning that the argument of the environmentalist does not depend on the assumption that the requirement of two hulls on oil tankers, although initially costly, will save money over time by reducing cleanup costs? \n Option0: Environmentalists are not calling for the outright ban of the oil industry, but rather accepting financial responsibility for potential negative environmental consequences or preventing negative outcomes. \n Option1: Environmentalists believe that because the oil  industry is not willing to adopt costly solutions to prevent environmental damage or incorporate the negative externalities into the true social cost of their industry from potential spills, then government is needed to establish the needed safety standards. \n Option2: Not enough information is provided on the cost of double hull tankers and the cost savings from reduction of potential spills. \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: An analysis of the XO Candy Corporation divided its products into two categories: chocolate-based candies and non-chocolate-based candies. The analysis shows that, unlike the non-chocolate candies, few chocolate candies sold enough units to be profitable. Nevertheless, stopping production of the unprofitable chocolate candies will not necessarily make the entire company more profitable, because__ . \n Question:  What is the evidence that suggests that the conclusion that the recipes of the chocolate candies date from the 19th century, while the non-chocolate candies were all developed more recently does not logically complete the passage? \n Option0: Customers being attracted to a certain overall unprofitable product category before moving on to be more regular and loyal consumers of the more profitable product category explains why as the statement says, the former category is worthwhile to keep around for overall company profitability. \n Option1: No part of the argument suggests that the date that certain product categories were developed is of relevance to the sensibility of what categories to continue producing. \n Option2: If a product category is not especially profitable, merely changing the particular products in that category doesn't mean that the category will necessarily become profitable. \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: Art critic: Nowadays, museum visitors seldom pause to look at a work of art for even a full minute. They look, perhaps take a snapshot, and move on. This tells us something about how our relationship to art has changed over time. People have become less willing to engage with works of art than they once were. \n Question: What evidence is there to suggest that the art critic's argument does not rely on the assumption that museum visitors who take snapshots of works of art rarely look at the pictures afterward? \n Option0: The art critic does not make any claim about how often people look at the pictures after taking snapshots of works of art, nor do they draw a direct logical connection between looking at snapshots of art and engagement with the art. \n Option1: The art critic does not make any claim about how many pieces of art people look at per museum visit, nor do they draw a direct logical connection between looking at how many pieces of art are looked at and engagement with the art. \n Option2: The only evidence that the art critic uses to support their conclusion about engagement with works of art is how short the time is that museum visitors spend looking at a work of art. \n Option3: The art critic does assert that people take less time to engage with art than they did in the past, but does not claim that taking more time would increase their enjoyment. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: Migraines are caused by changes in certain blood vessels of the brain that result in a local disturbance in the action of a specific nerve-activating chemical. Two migraine remedies, drug K and drug L, have exactly the same restorative effects on the local action of this chemical, but L also disrupts the action of several other chemicals in the brain that governmental activity and the body' s metabolism. \n Question:  Why does the information not strongly support the hypothesis that K, unlike L, should be administered immediately after the onset of a migraine? \n Option0: Differences in administration times are not mentioned in the passage and neither is effectiveness based upon the timing of when each drug is administered following onset of a migraine. \n Option1: Each drug is stated to be effective in restoring the effects of the chemical imbalance that is resulting in the person experiencing the migraine. \n Option2: Drug L disrupts the action of other chemicals in the brain while Drug K does not. No other effects are listed as being associated with Drug L other than the cessation of migraines. \n Option3: The two drugs are stated to have the exact same restorative effects and neither is listed as being either faster or slower than the other. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n", "Context: John: There have been complaints about the lack of parks in our city. Some people favor turning the old airport land into biking and hiking trails, but there may be more productive ways of using that land. Pablo: But the old airport land is ideal for biking and hiking trails. Our citizens have gone too long with an inadequate number of parks; we should not dismiss this proposal for biking and hiking trails without further consideration. \n Question: What is the basis for Pablo's criticism that suggests he interpreted John to be recommending that the proposal for converting the old airport land into biking and hiking trails should be promptly dismissed? \n Option0: None of the above choices \n Option1: Pablo argues with John that the idea of biking and hiking trails on the land is ideal and should not dismiss the idea, this shows that he believes John doesn't want to continue with the idea of using the land made for biking and hiking trails. \n Option2: Pablo is arguing with John that the land is best used to make the trails while John argues it may not be the best, neither are arguing that it is not possible to make the land into trails. \n Option3: John makes no alternative park ideas, only stating the land may be used for something else than biking and hiking trails, so Pablo sees it as John being against the latter, not for any other park ideas. \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: Food company engineer: I stand by my decision to order the dumping of small amounts of chemicals into the local river even though there is some evidence that this material may pose health problems. 1 fish in the river myself and will continue to do so. Furthermore, I will have no problem if other food manufacturers do what our company does. \n Question: What is the basis for concluding that the engineer's reasoning closely conforms to the principle that one is justified in performing an act if one is willing to submit oneself to the consequences of that action performed by oneself or others? \n Option0: None of the above choices \n Option1: the greatest number of people would be benefited by no dumping in the river \n Option2: The engineer says they themselves fish in the river and will continue to do so despite his dumping. \n Option3: The engineer made the decision to dump in the river prior to others and states they don't mind if others do as well. \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: Some theorists argue that literary critics should strive to be value-neutral in their literary criticism. These theorists maintain that by exposing the meaning of literary works without evaluating them, critics will enable readers to make their own judgments about the works' merits. But literary criticism cannot be completely value-neutral. Thus, some theorists are mistaken about what is an appropriate goal for literary criticism. \n Question:  Why does the argument's conclusion not follow logically even if it is assumed that the less readers understand the meaning of a literary work, the less capable they will be of evaluating that work's merits? \n Option0: The line in the passage says it right out that literary criticism cannot be value neutral, so by this logic there should be no criticism.  \n Option1: This does not relate to the claim made because readers are not supposed to be evaluating the work. \n Option2: This passage is saying that readers should make their own judgements, not be influenced by a critic.  \n Option3: The passage never mentions this phenomena , this would not lead to value neutral criticism.  \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: A recent study showed that people who address problems quickly and directly are significantly less likely to have gum disease than are people who react to problems by refusing to think about them. Since stress can have a negative effect on the immune system, the study' s results clearly indicate that some forms of gum disease are caused or aggravated by suppression of the immune system. \n Question: What evidence is needed to support the argument that people who tend to address problems quickly and directly will invariably seek dental care at the first sign of problems? \n Option0: Seeking dental care as a first option cannot be assumed as there are other avenues for addressing dental problems quickly. \n Option1: The author mentions stress leading to worse dental outcomes but does not say or reference how people with stressful lives react to problems. \n Option2: Some forms of dental disease are caused by lowered immune system and one factor that causes this is stress. \n Option3: Pain is not an indicator that problems will or will not be tackled quickly or directly. \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: Some students attending a small university with a well-known choir live off campus. From the fact that all music majors are members of the choir, a professor in the music department concluded that none of the students who live off campus is a music major. \n Question: Why does the professor's conclusion not properly follow even if it is assumed that all students who live on campus are music majors? \n Option0: On campus students are not relevant to the makeup of off campus students in regards to choir membership or major. \n Option1: While all music majors may be members of the choir, there could be students with other majors that are also members. \n Option2: None of the above choices \n Option3: Since all members of the choir are music majors, none of the people living off campus could be choir members since they were not music majors.  \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n", "Context: The United States government generally tries to protect valuable natural resources. But one resource has been ignored for too long. In the United States, each bushel of corn produced might result in the loss of as much as two bushels of topsoil. Moreover, in the last 100 years, the topsoil in many states, which once was about fourteen inches thick, has been eroded to only six or eight inches. Nonetheless, federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have remained at ridiculously low levels. Total federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have been less than the allocations of some individual states. \n Question:  Explain why the claim that soil conservation is a responsibility of the federal government, not the states does not express the main point of the argument. \n Option0: There was o comparison in the cost effectiveness of corn. There was only a comparison of amount of topsoil used per bushel of corn. \n Option1: Soil conservation from both the state and federal government was mentioned in the text, with no preference for who is responsible.  \n Option2: The text does not mention how much money is spend in each state by the government. It only mentions the total spending to be less that what some of the states spend themselves. \n Option3: Stating that the total federal spending is below what some individual states spends serves to highlight how little they have spent. The text states that soil conservation has been ignored. This implies that the government needs to spend more to converse the soil. \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: When a polygraph test is judged inconclusive, this is no reflection on the examinee. Rather, such a judgment means that the test has failed to show whether the examinee was truthful or untruthful. Nevertheless, employers will sometimes refuse to hire a job applicant because of an inconclusive polygraph test result. \n Question: What is the basis for not concluding that a polygraph test indicating that an examinee is untruthful can sometimes be mistaken based on the information above? \n Option0: Inclusive polygraph test results do not indicate anything about the examinees, including how truthful they are as a whole. \n Option1: None of the above choices \n Option2: Employers may refuse to hire job applicants due to inconclusive polygraph test results, but there is no indication that employers have refused to use polygraph test results for hiring purposes. \n Option3: An inconclusive polygraph test result does not indicate anything about the examinee, so refusing to hire such an examinee on the basis of their polygraph test result is unfair. \n Answer: The answer is Option1 \n Context: Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income. But pharmacists have a financial interest in having a monopoly on the sale of prescription medicines, so their objection to the sale of medicines by doctors cannot be taken seriously. \n Question: What is the rationale for the patient's argument attempting to discredit a position by questioning the motives of the proponents of that position? \n Option0: Lack of pharmacists' knowledge was not highlighted in the argument against putting them in charge of prescriptions \n Option1: The patient does not invoke public opinion in their argument but instead highlights the incentive structure which introduces conflicts for pharmacists and doctors. \n Option2: The patient correctly highlights that the pharmacists position also has a potential conflict of interest just like those of the doctors \n Option3: None of the above choices \n Answer: The answer is Option2 \n Context: In a town containing a tourist attraction, hotel and restaurant revenues each increased more rapidly over the past year than did revenue from the sale of passes to the attraction, which are valid for a full year. This led those in charge of the attraction to hypothesize that visitors were illicitly selling or sharing the passes. \n Question: Why does the fact that the local board of tourism reports that the average length of stay for tourists remained unchanged over the past year not weaken the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction? \n Option0: If this was true, it would not undermine the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction, because it would mean that the increased revenues of the hotel and restaurant industries are NOT due to tourists taking longer vacations (thus paying more for lodging, meals, etc.). Therefore, there must still be some other reason that hotel/restaurant revenues are increasingly more rapidly than the revenue of the tourist attraction, leaving the illegal selling/sharing of passes as a possibility.  \n Option1: This answer does help to undermine the attraction owners' argument because if this statement is true, then it's probably the higher prices of hotels and meals that have caused the hotel and restaurant industries' profits to increase. If the cost of the attraction passes has NOT increased, it makes sense that they would see less revenue growth than the restaurant/hotel industries. \n Option2: This answer does help to undermine the attraction owners' argument. If other attractions have opened up over the past year, it could simply be that the attraction is experiencing more competition. It doesn't have to be true that people are selling or sharing their passes; it could just be that people are choosing to patronize attractions other than this attraction.  \n Option3: This does help to undermine the attraction owners' argument because if the passes are a one-time expense, and then people can visit for a whole year, the repeat visitors are essentially getting in for \"Free.\" They pay the cost upfront, and then the attraction makes no more revenue off them for a whole year. So if people possessing passes are making frequent trips to the attraction throughout the year, it makes sense that the attraction's revenues would stagnate.  \n Answer: The answer is Option0 \n Context: Any sale item that is purchased can be returned for store credit but not for a refund of the purchase price. Every home appliance and every piece of gardening equipment is on sale along with selected construction tools. \n Question: Explain why it is not necessary that some construction tools are not returnable for store credit in order for the statement to be true? \n Option0: Gardening equipment is on sale, and no sale item can be refunded, so this is necessarily true.  \n Option1: This may or may not be true, but we don't have any information on non-sale items.  \n Option2: None of the above choices \n Option3: Some construction tools are on sale, which means some are not, and we don't have any information on non-sale construction tools.  \n Answer: The answer is Option3 \n"]}}, {"name": "cot_step_random", "prompt": {"context": [["Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income.

But pharmacists have a financial interest in having a monopoly on the sale of prescription medicines, so their objection to the sale of medicines by doctors cannot be taken seriously. \n Question: The patient's argument proceeds by \n Option0: attempting to discredit a position by questioning the motives of the proponents of that position \n Option1: rejecting a questionable position on the grounds that the general public does not support that position \n Option2: pointing out an unstated assumption on which the pharmacists' argument relies and then refuting it \n Option3: asserting that pharmacists lack the appropriate knowledge to have informed opinions on the subject under discussion \n Answer: The patient correctly highlights that the pharmacists position also has a potential conflict of interest just like those of the doctors Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1, 000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier. \n Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage? \n Option0: Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950. \n Option1: As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases. \n Option2: If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline. \n Option3: The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury. \n Answer: This was stated as the first statement that ski injuries have dropped in percentage over that time. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: H. G Wells' s great dramatic novel The Time Machine is classified as science fiction simply because it takes place in the future. But this classification is inappropriate because Wells' s book possesses something that great dramatic novels have and science fiction generally lacks -- compelling characters that enable the reader to become absorbed in their plight and not just in the author' s representation of the future of technology. \n Question: The argument's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: All novels that contain compelling characters are great dramatic novels. \n Option1: Novels can always be clearly classified into distinct genres. \n Option2: A dramatic novel cannot both be great and belong to the genre of science fiction. \n Option3: A work of science fiction cannot achieve greatness unless it contains compelling characters. \n Answer: The author states that because a particular genre of book category, generally does not have a subjective trait of compelling characters, that a book classified in said category, cannot be a member of said category, science fiction, because this book does indeed have compelling characters.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Doctors in Britain have long suspected that patients who wear tinted eyeglasses are abnormally prone to depression and hypochondria. Psychological tests given there to hospital patients admitted for physical complaints like heart pain and digestive distress confirmed such a relationship. Perhaps people whose relationship to the world is psychologically painful choose such glasses to reduce visual stimulation, which is perceived as irritating. At any rate, it can be concluded that when such glasses are worn, it is because the wearer has a tendency to be depressed or hypochondriacal. \n Question: The argument assumes which one of the following? \n Option0: For hypochondriacs wearing tinted glasses, the glasses serve as a visual signal to others that the wearer's health is delicate. \n Option1: Depression is not caused in some cases by an organic condition of the body. \n Option2: The tinting does not dim light to the eye enough to depress the wearer's mood substantially. \n Option3: Wearers do not think of the tinted glasses as a means of distancing themselves from other people. \n Answer: The argument assumes that the wearer chooses tinted glasses because they are depressed, and thus assumes that the tinting does not cause the condition itself. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Advertisement: Attention homeowners! All the pests in your yard will die within minutes of being treated by JTE pesticide. What' s better, JTE pesticide is not harmful to the birds or small animals that make your yard their home. By using JTE, you can eliminate the pests in your yard and keep the rabbits and birds. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? \n Option0: JTE pesticide will not harm the underground water supply. \n Option1: JTE has met all state and federal environmental standards. \n Option2: The rabbits, birds, or other small animals are not in your yard because of the pests. \n Option3: The effectiveness of JTE pesticide does not depend on the strict adherence to specific application procedures. \n Answer: This is true because if it is saying it will kill all of the pests but you will still be able to keep the birds and rabbits than they do not need to pests in order to be in your yard. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: Teachers should not do anything to cause their students to lose respect for them. And students can sense when someone is trying to hide his or her ignorance. Ttherefore, a teacher who does not know the answer to a question a student has asked should not pretend to know the answer. \n Question: The conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: Students respect honesty above all else. \n Option1: Students lose respect for teachers whenever they sense that the teachers are trying to hide their ignorance. \n Option2: Students' respect for a teacher is independent of the amount of knowledge they attribute to that teacher. \n Option3: A teacher cannot be effective unless he or she retains the respect of students. \n Answer: The assumption is that students' respect for the teacher is based on how much knowledge the teacher has. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Miguel has four family members who plan to come to his graduation on Sunday afternoon, but it is likely that only three of them will be allowed to attend. Normally graduation is held in the football stadium, where there is no limit on the number of family members who can attend. However, the ceremony is relocated to the gymnasium if it rains, and each graduate receives just three admission tickets for use by family members. \n Question: The conclusion of the argument is most strongly supported if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: Miguel has several friends who have fewer than three family members coming to graduation. \n Option1: Miguel's graduating class is much larger than usual. \n Option2: Miguel has a fifth family member who is unable to come to his graduation. \n Option3: The weather service has indicated that there is a very high likelihood of rain on Sunday afternoon. \n Answer: Rain would preclude the use of the stadium which has no limit of the number of family members attending and force the use of the gymnasium, which limits the number attending to three.  Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Food company engineer: I stand by my decision to order the dumping of small amounts of chemicals into the local river even though there is some evidence that this material may pose health problems. 1 fish in the river myself and will continue to do so. Furthermore, I will have no problem if other food manufacturers do what our company does. \n Question: The engineer's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? \n Option0: One is justified in performing an act if one is willing to submit oneself to the consequences of that action performed by oneself or others. \n Option1: One should always choose to act in a way that will benefit the greatest number of people. \n Option2: One is justified in performing an act if other people are also planning to perform that kind of act. \n Option3: One should never perform an act until one has fully analyzed all the ways in which that act could impact others. \n Answer: The engineer says they themselves fish in the river and will continue to do so despite his dumping. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: Counselor: Those who believe that criticism should be gentle rather than harsh should consider the following: change requires a motive, and criticism that is unpleasant provides a motive. Since harsh criticism is unpleasant, harsh criticism provides a motive. Ttherefore, only harsh criticism will cause the person criticized to change. \n Question: The reasoning in the counselor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument \n Option0: fails to address the possibility that in some cases the primary goal of criticism is something other than bringing about change in the person being criticized \n Option1: takes for granted that everyone who is motivated to change will change \n Option2: infers that something that is sufficient to provide a motive is necessary to provide a motive \n Option3: confuses a motive for doing something with a motive for avoiding something \n Answer: Although harsh criticism does indeed work in order to cause change, it is not the only strategy that has been used to implement change in others. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Like airplane accidents, most accidents in medical care result from human error, particularly failures in communication, leadership, and decision making. Following the introduction of standard procedures governing these three areas, the airline industry succeeded in significantly reducing the number and severity of accidents. Since airplane flights and health care delivery both require the cooperation of groups of people with diverse knowledge and skills, the medical care community should adopt a similar set of procedures in order to reduce errors. \n Question: Which one of the following is a technique of reasoning used in the argument? \n Option0: providing examples in order to show that two seemingly dissimilar situations are in fact the same \n Option1: defending a general principle by presenting two separate successful applications of that principle \n Option2: arguing for taking a course of action based on results of taking such action in an analogous situation \n Option3: justifying the introduction of a set of procedures by outlining undesirable results in an analogous situation in which those procedures were not followed \n Answer: The passage is stating that the airplane and healthcare industries face similar accident and that the action of one being successful could be succesful in the other. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: Ten years ago, the Salisbury City Council passed the Culinary Bill, new legislation to protect the interests of local non-franchise restaurants. Of the 120 local non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury today, 85 opened during the last ten years. Clearly the Culinary Bill has caused a surge in the number of local non-franchise restaurants operating in Salisbury over the past ten years. \n Question: Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? \n Option0: All economic indicators suggest that household incomes in Salisbury have risen substantially over the past ten years. \n Option1: The Culinary Bill provides no benefit to restaurants that are members of national franchise chains \n Option2: Most of the consumers in Salisbury who patronize these local restaurants are aware of the provisions of the Culinary Bill and approve of them. \n Option3: Of the local non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury ten years ago, fewer than 85 have closed. \n Answer: The passage tells us that there are 120 non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury and that of those 120 restaurants 85 opened in the last ten years. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: In polluted industrial English cities during the Industrial Revolution, two plant diseases -- black spot, which infects roses, and tar spot, which infects sycamore trees -- disappeared. It is likely that air pollution eradicated these diseases. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the reasoning above? \n Option0: Scientists theorize that some plants can develop a resistance to air pollution. \n Option1: Black spot and tar spot returned when the air in the cities became less polluted. \n Option2: For many plant species, scientists have not determined the effects of air pollution. \n Option3: Black spot and tar spot were the only plant diseases that disappeared in any English cities during the Industrial Revolution. \n Answer: The author stated that it is likely that air pollution eradicated these diseases, so a lack of air pollution would bring the diseases back. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Editorial: It is clear that if this country' s universities were living up to both their moral and their intellectual responsibilities, the best-selling publications in most university bookstores would not be frivolous ones like TV Today and Gossip Review. However, in most university bookstores the only publication that sells better than Gossip Review is TV Today. \n Question: If the statements in the editorial are true, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of them? \n Option0: At least some of this country's universities are not meeting their moral responsibilities or their intellectual responsibilities or both. \n Option1: People who purchase publications that are devoted primarily to gossip or to television programming are intellectually irresponsible. \n Option2: Many people who attend this country's universities fail to live up to both their moral and their intellectual responsibilities. \n Option3: It is irresponsible for university bookstores to carry publications such as Gossip Review and TV Today. \n Answer: The best-selling publications in university bookstores are frivolous ones like TV Today and Gossip Review, so based on the editorial, this country's universities cannot be living up to both their moral and intellectual responsibilities. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history, but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons. We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I. \n Question: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? \n Option0: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it. \n Option1: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false. \n Option2: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion. \n Option3: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting. \n Answer: The position that we should learn the lessons of history is argued against in specific ways by the author. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: A reason Larson cannot do the assignment is that she has an unavoidable scheduling conflict. On the other hand, a reason Franks cannot do the assignment is that he does not quite have the assertiveness the task requires. So, the task must be assigned to Parker, the only supervisor in the shipping department other than Larson and Franks. \n Question: The argument depends on assuming which one of the following? \n Option0: Franks would be assigned the task if Franks had the assertiveness the task requires. \n Option1: Larson has the assertiveness the task requires. \n Option2: The task cannot be assigned to anyone who has any kind of scheduling conflict. \n Option3: The task cannot be assigned to anyone other than a supervisor in the shipping department. \n Answer: The argument states that the task must be given to the only supervisor left who can do it but if the task could be assigned to a person who is not a supervisor there could be more options for who to assign it to. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n", "Context: City council member: Despite the city' s desperate need to exploit any available source of revenue, the mayor has repeatedly blocked council members' attempts to pass legislation imposing real estate development fees. It is clear that in doing so the mayor is sacrificing the city' s interests to personal interests. The mayor cites figures to show that, in the current market, fees of the size proposed would significantly reduce the number of building starts and thus, on balance, result in a revenue loss to the city. But the important point is that the mayor' s family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter. \n Question: Which one of the following most accurately and completely expresses the main conclusion of the city council member's argument? \n Option0: Significantly reducing the number of building starts would not, on balance, result in revenue loss to the city. \n Option1: Imposing real estate development fees is the best way for the city to exploit the available sources of revenue. \n Option2: The mayor's family has a strong financial interest in preventing the passage of legislation that would impose real estate development fees. \n Option3: In blocking council members' attempts to impose real estate development fees, the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests. \n Answer: The argument concludes that the mayor's reluctance to impose development fees is due to his and his family's personal financial interest in the matter, due to them being impacted by such fees.  Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Many people change their wills on their own every few years, in response to significant changes in their personal or financial circumstances. This practice can create a problem for the executor when these people are careless and do not date their wills: the executor will then often know neither which one of several undated wills is the most recent, nor whether the will drawn up last has ever been found. Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. \n Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument \n Option0: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause \n Option1: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution \n Option2: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem \n Option3: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have \n Answer: Dating the will would solve the problem of determining it's relative recency, but would not establish whether or not the most recent will had been found, contrary to the claim made by the argument.  Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: In the paintings by seventeenth-century Dutch artist Vermeer, we find several recurrent items: a satin jacket, a certain Turkish carpet, and wooden chairs with lion' s head finials. These reappearing objects might seem to evince a dearth of props. Yet we know that many of the props Vermeer used were expensive. Thus, while we might speculate about exactly why Vermeer worked with a small number of familiar objects, it was clearly not for lack of props that the recurrent items were used. \n Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: If a dearth of props accounted for the recurrent objects in Vermeer's paintings, we would not see expensive props in any of them. \n Option1: The props that recur in Vermeer's paintings were always available to him. \n Option2: The satin jacket and wooden chairs that recur in the paintings were owned by Vermeer's sister. \n Option3: The several recurrent items that appeared in Vermeer's paintings had special sentimental importance for him. \n Answer: If Vermeer could afford to purchase the expensive items that are seen as props in his works, then he could certainly afford to purchase many inexpensive props as well. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: According to a prediction of the not-so-distant future published in 1940, electricity would revolutionize agriculture. Electrodes would be inserted into the soil, and the current between them would kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger. \n Question: Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed? \n Option0: In order for farmers to avoid electric shock while working in the fields, the current could be turned off at such times without diminishing the intended effects. \n Option1: Because a planting machine would need to avoid coming into contact with the electrodes, new parts for planting machines would need to be designed. \n Option2: It cannot be taken for granted that the use of electricity is always beneficial. \n Option3: Since weeds are plants, electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants. \n Answer: This shows a great flaw in the prediction and logo because weeds and crops are both types of plants and no explanation as to how the machine would know the difference between types of plants is given in the prediction. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Most people are indignant at the suggestion that they are not reliable authorities about their real wants. Such self-knowledge, however, is not the easiest kind of knowledge to acquire. Indeed, acquiring it often requires hard and even potentially risky work. To avoid such effort, people unconsciously convince themselves that they want what society says they should want. \n Question: The main point of the argument is that \n Option0: people cannot really want what they should want \n Option1: knowledge of what one really wants is not as desirable as it is usually thought to be \n Option2: people are not necessarily reliable authorities about what they really want \n Option3: people usually avoid making difficult decisions \n Answer: None of the above choices Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: When a group of people starts a company, the founders usually serve as sources both of funding and of skills in marketing, management, and technical matters. It is unlikely that a single individual can both provide adequate funding and be skilled in marketing, management, and technical matters. Ttherefore, companies founded by groups are more likely to succeed than companies founded by individuals. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? \n Option0: Some founding members of successful companies can provide both funding and skills in marketing, management, or technical matters. \n Option1: Founders of a new company can more easily acquire marketing and management abilities than technical abilities. \n Option2: New companies are more likely to succeed when their founders can provide adequate funding and skills in marketing, management, and technical abilities than if they must secure funding or skills from nonfounders. \n Option3: A new company is more likely to succeed if every founding member contributes equally to the company's initial funding than if some members contribute more funds than others. \n Answer: The argument states that these skills are important when starting a new company. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Trustee: The recent exhibit at the art museum was extensively covered by the local media, and this coverage seems to have contributed to the record-breaking attendance it drew. If the attendance at the exhibit had been low, the museum would have gone bankrupt and closed permanently, so the museum could not have remained open had it not been for the coverage from the local media. \n Question: The reasoning in the trustee's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument \n Option0: presupposes the very conclusion that it is trying to prove \n Option1: takes for granted that most people who read articles about the exhibit also attended the exhibit \n Option2: fails to address the possibility that the exhibit would have drawn enough visitors to prevent bankruptcy even without media coverage \n Option3: takes for granted that no previous exhibit at the museum had received such extensive media coverage \n Answer: This is perfect causation without correlation. There is no way to know whether there would have been many attendees, there is no control group.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Undoubtedly, one' s freedom is always worth the risk of losing one' s life. Consider a person who is locked in a bare cement room with no hope of escape. This person is not really living and has nothing to lose. \n Question: A flaw in the argument's reasoning is that the argument \n Option0: generalizes inappropriately from a single extreme case to a universal claim \n Option1: presumes, without providing justification, that nothing can have greater value than one's own freedom \n Option2: fails to consider that it is not always possible to rebel physically against an encroachment on one's freedom \n Option3: fails to establish that the freedom of others is worth taking risks for \n Answer: It isn't taking into account more realistic events that one faces.  It is presenting you with a solely life or death situation. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The traditional view of the Roman emperor Caligula as a cruel and insane tyrant has been challenged by some modern historians. They point out that little documentation of Caligula' s alleged cruelty or outrageous behavior survives from the time of his reign and that the histories that have come down to us were written by his enemies. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the challenge from the modem historians? \n Option0: People who have lived under someone regarded as a cruel tyrant are more likely to view that person unfavorably than favorably. \n Option1: The specific outrageous acts attributed to Caligula in Roman documentation are very similar to acts attributed in earlier writings to other rulers alleged to be cruel tyrants. \n Option2: There is less documentation of any sort from Caligula's reign than from the reigns of most other Roman emperors of Caligula's era. \n Option3: There is ample documentation of modern tyrants being responsible for outrageous acts worse than those attributed to Caligula. \n Answer: This just shows that rulers of this time had a certain standard and Caligula was no more cruel than anyone else. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: In Country X' s last election, the Reform Party beat its main opponent, the Conservative Party, although pollsters, employing in-person interviews shortly before the vote, had projected a Conservative Party victory. Afterwards, the pollsters determined that, unlike Conservative Party supporters, Reform Party supporters were less likely to express their party preference during in-person interviews than they were during telephone interviews. Ttherefore, using only telephone interviews instead would likely result in more accurate projections for the next election. \n Question: Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the argument in the passage? \n Option0: For each person interviewed in telephone polls before the next election, pollsters will be able to reasonably determine the likelihood of that person voting. \n Option1: In the next election, pollsters will be able to conduct more in-person interviews than telephone interviews. \n Option2: The number of voters in Country X's next election will be significantly larger than the number of voters in the last election. \n Option3: The Conservative Party will win the next election. \n Answer: In order for the party preferences of people interviewed by telephone to matter, it must be known about how many of them will actually vote. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n"]}}, {"name": "cot_step_complex", "prompt": {"context": [["In a town containing a tourist attraction, hotel and restaurant revenues each increased more rapidly over the past year than did revenue from the sale of passes to the attraction, which are valid for a full year.

This led those in charge of the attraction to hypothesize that visitors were illicitly selling or sharing the passes. \n Question: Each of the following, if true, helps to undermine the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction EXCEPT: \n Option0: During the past year other tourist attractions have opened up in the area. \n Option1: While the cost of passes is unchanged since last year, hotel and meal prices have risen. \n Option2: The local board of tourism reports that the average length of stay for tourists remained unchanged over the past year. \n Option3: Those possessing passes made more frequent trips to the attraction last year than in previous years. \n Answer: If this was true, it would not undermine the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction, because it would mean that the increased revenues of the hotel and restaurant industries are NOT due to tourists taking longer vacations (thus paying more for lodging, meals, etc.). Therefore, there must still be some other reason that hotel/restaurant revenues are increasingly more rapidly than the revenue of the tourist attraction, leaving the illegal selling/sharing of passes as a possibility. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Business ethicist: Managers of corporations have an obligation to serve shareholders as the shareholders would want to be served. Ttherefore, corporate managers have an obligation to act in the shareholders' best interest. \n Question: The business ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: Shareholders would want to be served only in ways that are in their own best interest. \n Option1: Corporate managers are always able to discern what is in the best interest of shareholders. \n Option2: All shareholders want to be served in identical ways. \n Option3: The shareholders have interests that can best be served by corporate managers. \n Answer: The obligation to serve shareholders as they would want to be served and therefore being obligated to serve them in their best interest assumes that shareholders want to be served in their own best interest. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: Studies suggest that, for the vast majority of people who have normal blood pressure, any amount of sodium greater than that required by the body is simply excreted and does not significantly raise blood pressure. So only persons who have high blood pressure and whose bodies are incapable of safely processing excess sodium need to restrict their sodium intake. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument? \n Option0: Every human being has a physiological need for at least some sodium. \n Option1: Any sodium not used by the body will increase blood pressure unless it is excreted. \n Option2: Excess sodium intake over time often destroys the body's ability to process excess sodium. \n Option3: High blood pressure is more harmful than was previously believed. \n Answer: This would weaken the argument that only people who can not process the excess sodium should decrease their consumption. If excess sodium will eventually destroy the body's ability to secrete it, then that is true for all people. According to that, all people should decrease sodium intake. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Announcement for a television program: Are female physicians more sensitive than male physicians to the needs of women patients? To get the answer, we' ll ask physicians of both sexes this question. Tune in tomorrow. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, identifies a flaw in the plan for the program? \n Option0: There still are fewer women than men who are physicians, so a patient might not have the opportunity to choose a woman as a physician. \n Option1: Women as patients are now beginning to take a more active role in managing their care and making sure that they understand the medical alternatives. \n Option2: Those who are best able to provide answers to the question are patients, rather than physicians. \n Option3: Physicians are in general unwilling to describe the treatment style of other physicians. \n Answer: Questioning the physicians about whether they are more helpful to female patients does not actually answer the question of whether they are helpful to the female patients; you have to question the patients to get an accurate answer to this question. So this option does point out this flaw in the reasoning of the passage. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: A new gardening rake with an S-shaped handle reduces compression stress on the spine during the pull stroke to about one-fifth of what it is with a straight-handled rake. During the push stroke, however, compression stress is five times more with the new rake than with a straight-handled rake. Neither the push stroke nor the pull stroke with a straight-handled rake produces enough compression stress to cause injury, but compression stress during the push stroke with the new rake is above the danger level. Ttherefore, straight-handled rakes are better than the new rakes for minimizing risk of spinal injury. \n Question: The conclusion above is properly drawn from the premises given if which one of the following is true? \n Option0: Compression stress resulting from pushing is the only cause of injuries to the spine that occur as a result of raking. \n Option1: A garden rake can never be used in such a way that all the strokes with that rake are push strokes. \n Option2: It is not possible to design a garden rake with a handle that is other than straight or S-shaped. \n Option3: Raking is a frequent cause of spinal injury among gardeners. \n Answer: If compression stress resulting from pushing is the only cause of spine injuries from raking, then a straight-handled rake is better than an s-handled rake because a straight-handled rake puts less pressure stress on the spine during the push stroke. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n ", "Context: MetroBank made loans to ten small companies, in amounts ranging from $1, 000 to $100, 000. These ten loans all had graduated payment plans, i. e. , the scheduled monthly loan payment increased slightly each month over the five-year term of the loan. Nonetheless, the average payment received by MetroBank for these ten loans had decreased by the end of the five-year term. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the statements above? \n Option0: Of the ten small companies, the three that had borrowed the largest amounts paid off their loans within three years. \n Option1: For some loans made by MetroBank, the monthly payment decreases slightly over the term of the loan. \n Option2: The number of small companies receiving new loans from MetroBank increased over the five-year term. \n Option3: Most banks offer a greater number of loans for under $100, 000 than for over $100, 000. \n Answer: If, on a graduated payment plan, then the payments increase over the life of the loan. As payments increase, the average received would increase. The only way it would decrease is if the number of loans decreased. Since the largest amounts would have the largest payments, they would affect the average more than a small amount. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The five senses have traditionally been viewed as distinct yet complementary. Each sense is thought to have its own range of stimuli that are incapable of stimulating the other senses. However, recent research has discovered that some people taste a banana and claim that they are tasting blue, or see a color and say that it has a specific smell. This shows that such people, called synesthesiacs, have senses that do not respect the usual boundaries between the five recognized senses. \n Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? \n Option0: Recent evidence strongly suggests that there are other senses besides sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste. \n Option1: Synesthesiacs can be temporarily rid of their synesthetic experiences by the use of drugs. \n Option2: The particular ways in which sensory experiences overlap in synesthesiacs follow a definite pattern. \n Option3: Synesthesiacs demonstrate a general, systematic impairment in their ability to use and understand words. \n Answer: If Synesthesiacs demonstrate a general, systematic impairment in their ability to use and understand words it may be that they are just unable to understand or adequately describe what they are experiencing and so do not actually mean they are tasting colors or similar. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Modern science is built on the process of posing hypotheses and testing them against observations -- in essence, attempting to show that the hypotheses are incorrect. Nothing brings more recognition than overthrowing conventional wisdom. It is accordingly unsurprising that some scientists are skeptical of the widely accepted predictions of global warming. What is instead remarkable is that with hundreds of researchers striving to make breakthroughs in climatology, very few find evidence that global warming is unlikely. \n Question: The information above provides the most support for which one of the following statements? \n Option0: Research in global warming is primarily driven by a desire for recognition in the scientific community. \n Option1: Most researchers in climatology have substantial motive to find evidence that would discredit the global warming hypothesis. \n Option2: There is evidence that conclusively shows that the global warming hypothesis is true. \n Option3: Scientists who are skeptical about global warming have not offered any alternative hypotheses to explain climatological data. \n Answer: Because the author argues recognition comes from overthrowing conventional wisdom, and because the global warming hypothesis is conventional wisdom, it would stand to reason that most scientists have substantial motive to disprove it. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: The United States government generally tries to protect valuable natural resources. But one resource has been ignored for too long. In the United States, each bushel of corn produced might result in the loss of as much as two bushels of topsoil. Moreover, in the last 100 years, the topsoil in many states, which once was about fourteen inches thick, has been eroded to only six or eight inches. Nonetheless, federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have remained at ridiculously low levels. Total federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have been less than the allocations of some individual states. \n Question: Which one of the following best expresses the main point of the argument? \n Option0: The federal government's expenditures for soil conservation in the various states have been inequitable. \n Option1: Corn is not a cost-effective product and substitutes should be found where possible. \n Option2: Soil conservation is a responsibility of the federal government, not the states. \n Option3: The federal government should spend much more on soil conservation than it has been spending. \n Answer: Stating that the total federal spending is below what some individual states spends serves to highlight how little they have spent. The text states that soil conservation has been ignored. This implies that the government needs to spend more to converse the soil. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Doctor: While a few alternative medicines have dangerous side effects, some, such as many herbs, have been proven safe to consume. Thus, though there is little firm evidence of medicinal effect, advocates of these herbs as remedies for serious illnesses should always be allowed to prescribe them, since their patients will not be harmed, and might be helped, by the use of these products. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the doctor's argument? \n Option0: Some patients may have allergic reactions to certain medicines that have been tolerated by other patients. \n Option1: Any pain relief or other benefits of many herbs have been proven to derive entirely from patients' belief in the remedy, rather than from its biochemical properties. \n Option2: The vast majority of purveyors of alternative medicines are driven as much by the profit motive as by a regard for their patients' health. \n Option3: Many practitioners and patients neglect more effective conventional medicines in favor of herbal remedies. \n Answer: If doctors are always allowed to prescribe alternative medicines that are not proven to work then patients might assume that these will help them and not take more effective conventional medicines. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n ", "Context: Creating a database of all the plant species in the scientific record has proved to be no easy task. For centuries, botanists have been collecting and naming plants without realizing that many were in fact already named. And by using DNA analysis, botanists have shown that varieties of plants long thought to belong to the same species actually belong to different species. \n Question: Of the following claims, which one can most justifiably be rejected on the basis of the statements above? \n Option0: Duplicates and omissions in the scientific record also occur in fields other than botany. \n Option1: Botanists have no techniques for determining whether distinct plant species have been given distinct names. \n Option2: A person who consults the scientific record looking under only one of a plant's names may miss available information about that plant. \n Option3: Most of the duplicates and omissions among plant names in the scientific record have yet to be cleared up. \n Answer: If there were no methods for determining whether or not distinct plant species have been given distinct names, botanists would not be able to see that some plants previously thought to be the same species are not nor would they know there are those being named after having bene previously. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Politician: The cohesion of a society depends on its members' accepting a set of basic principles. When these principles are routinely called into question, the society begins to erode. Any society, ttherefore, that allows schools to present the society' s set of basic principles as simply one of several alternatives, with the suggestion that students may choose which to accept on the basis of the principles' worth, is inviting its own demise. \n Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most strengthen the politician's argument? \n Option0: Children are more likely than adults to question the wisdom of those who founded and shaped a society. \n Option1: Unless people believe that they have freely chosen to adopt the principles that govern their societies, they will tend to repudiate these principles. \n Option2: One cannot evaluate a set of political principles without having first established criteria of evaluation. \n Option3: Given the chance to assess the merits of the principles governing their societies, individuals will rarely find those principles acceptable. \n Answer: If individuals would not find the basic set of principles acceptable when given the chance to assess it, then individuals given that chance would be more likely to accept a different set of principles, causing members of a society to have differing sets of basic principles. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Paleontologist: It is widely, but falsely, held that life began in the ocean and did not exist on land until half a billion years ago. Traces of carbon 14 have been found throughout certain 1. 2-billion-year-old rock in North America. Carbon 14 is extracted by plants and microbes from the atmosphere to fuel their chemical reactions, and is then released when the plants and microbes die. \n Question: Each of the following, if true, provides additional support for the paleontologist's conclusion EXCEPT: \n Option0: The 1. 2-billion-year-old rocks were formed from soil containing very small amounts of carbon 14 that entered the soil directly from the atmosphere. \n Option1: Research suggests that some portions of the 1. 2-billion-year-old rocks were at one time submerged in water, though portions clearly never were. \n Option2: The severity of conditions in the primordial oceans would have made it difficult for life to begin there. \n Option3: Uranium testing has been used to confirm that the age of the rocks is 1. 2 billion years. \n Answer: The paleontologist needs proof that the carbon 14 was extracted by plants and microbes and ended up in the rocks. This option suggests a possibility of carbon 14 entering the soil without any help from living things. So this hurts the paleontologist's argument. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: Trainer: I recently developed an exercise routine that can get anybody to meet his or her goals. The routine combines cardio and bodybuilding during each session for the purpose of losing weight. Every person I' ve trained has lost weight on the program. \n Question: The strength of the argument depends on which one of the following? \n Option0: Every client the trainer has worked with has weight loss as a goal. \n Option1: Every client the trainer has worked with has prior experience lifting weights. \n Option2: Every client the trainer has worked with has also adopted a healthy diet. \n Option3: Losing weight is always a healthy outcome. \n Answer: The text states that the trainer can get anyone to meet their goals and every person they have trained have lost weight. There is no mention of achieving any other goal, therefore all their clients must have wanted to lose weight. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The primary task of a university is to educate. But to teach well, professors must be informed about new developments in their disciplines, and that requires research. Yet many universities cannot afford to support faculty research adequately. So a lack of funds for research adversely affects the degree to which a university can fulfill its central mission. \n Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion of the argument? \n Option0: Lack of financial support for faculty research is the root of ineffective teaching at universities. \n Option1: In order to be able to teach well, university professors must conduct research. \n Option2: Effective teaching is the primary mission of a university. \n Option3: Lack of funds for research reduces the quality of education a university provides. \n Answer: The text states that lack of research by the educators will have a varying degree of adverse effects. Since that will effect some of the ability to teach effectively, the quality of education is reduced. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n ", "Context: Legal commentator: The goal of a recently enacted law that bans smoking in workplaces is to protect employees from secondhand smoke. But the law is written in such a way that it cannot be interpreted as ever prohibiting people from smoking in their own homes. \n Question: The statements above, if true, provide a basis for rejecting which one of the following claims? \n Option0: Most people believe that smokers have a fundamental right to smoke in their own homes. \n Option1: The law offers no protection from secondhand smoke for people outside of their workplaces. \n Option2: The law will protect domestic workers such as housecleaners from secondhand smoke in their workplaces. \n Option3: Supporters of the law believe that it will have a significant impact on the health of many workers. \n Answer: This is not supported because the passage states that the law cannot be interpreted as prohibiting people from smoking in their own homes.  This would not protect domestic workers from secondhand smoke in their workplaces because the people who live in the homes they are working at would be allowed to smoke. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Economist: Our economy' s weakness is the direct result of consumers' continued reluctance to spend, which in turn is caused by factors such as high-priced goods and services. This reluctance is exacerbated by the fact that the average income is significantly lower than it was five years ago. Thus, even though it is not a perfect solution, if the government were to lower income taxes, the economy would improve. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the economist's argument? \n Option0: Lowering income taxes will have no effect on government spending. \n Option1: Increasing consumer spending will cause prices for goods and services to decrease. \n Option2: If income taxes are not lowered, consumers' wages will decline even further. \n Option3: Consumers will be less reluctant to spend money if income taxes are lowered. \n Answer: The author states that consumers are spending less, suggests that it is exacerbated by consumers having less disposable income, and then suggests that lower taxes will help, presumably because they'd have more disposable income and would be less reluctant. Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: The Ixazyiquo tribe are believed to be one of the few remaining tribes in the country of Malugiato to have never had any contact with the Lamandians, settlers who arrived in Malugiain during the last hundred years. Using satellite imagery, a team of anthropologists determined that the Ixazyiquo land is covered with thriving banana plantations. The anthropologists conclude that the Ixazyiquo tribe has in fact had direct contact with the Lamandians. \n Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the anthropologists' conclusion? \n Option0: There is no standard shape to the Ixazyiquobanana plantations, which have taken on a form that best fits the soil conditions. \n Option1: The Ixazyiquo are a hunter-gather society, which travel over vast areas of land to hunt. \n Option2: Maintaining banana plantations requires sophisticated knowledge that only the Lamadians possess. \n Option3: The Ixazyiquo have had extensive contact with the Wamalami, who have had direct contact with the Lamandians. \n Answer: If only Lamandians know how to maintain banana plantations, the presence of thriving banana plantations on Ixazyiquo land means that either there are Lamandians on Ixazyiquo land or that the Lamandians have provided this knowledge to the Ixazyiquo, both of which imply direct contact. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Political scientist: Some analysts point to the government' s acceptance of the recent protest rally as proof that the government supports freedom of popular expression. But the government supports no such thing. Supporting freedom of popular expression means accepting the expression of ideas that the government opposes as well as the expression of ideas that the government supports. The message of the protest rally was one that the government entirely supports. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that is required by the political scientist's argument? \n Option0: The government would not have accepted a protest rally whose message it opposed. \n Option1: The message of the recent protest rally did not concern any function of the government. \n Option2: The government feared a backlash if it did not show acceptance of the recent protest rally. \n Option3: There are groups that are inhibited from staging a protest rally out of a fear of government response. \n Answer: The text here states that the protest here was one the government supports. Freedom of expression applies to those the government do and do not support. The text implies that the government does not support views opposed to theirs. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: Because dried peat moss, which is derived from sphagnum moss, contains no chemical additives and is a renewable resource, many gardeners use large amounts of it as a soil conditioner in the belief that the practice is environmentally sound. They are mistaken. The millions of acres of sphagnum moss in the world contribute more oxygen to the atmosphere than do all of the world' s rain forests combined, and the garden soil industry is depleting these areas much faster than they can renew themselves. \n Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the argument's reasoning? \n Option0: A practice is environmentally sound if it helps to protect rain forests that contribute large amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere. \n Option1: A practice is not environmentally sound if it significantly reduces the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere. \n Option2: Using a product may be environmentally unsound even if the product is a renewable resource and contains no chemical additive. \n Option3: If the environmental benefits of a practice outweigh the environmental costs, that practice can be legitimately considered environmentally sound. \n Answer: If reducing the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere is environmentally unsound, then consuming a product which increases the oxygen content faster than such a product can regenerate itself will lead to a net reduction in oxygen addition, and thus by definition be environmentally unsound. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n ", "Context: All known living things are made of the same basic kinds of matter, are carbon based, and are equipped with genetic codes. So human life has the same origin as all other known life. \n Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: There can never be any living thing that does not have a genetic code. \n Option1: Any two living things made of the same basic kinds of matter have the same origin. \n Option2: Without the existence of other life forms, human life would never have come into existence. \n Option3: There are not any living beings that have genetic codes but are not carbon based. \n Answer: If any two living things made of the same basic kinds of matter have the same origin, and all known living things are made of the same basic kinds of matter, then a living thing that is human has the same origin as any other living thing. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Ferber's syndrome, a viral disease that frequently affects cattle, is transmitted to these animals through infected feed. Even though chickens commercially raised for meat are often fed the type of feed identified as the source of infection in cattle, Ferber's syndrome is only rarely observed in chickens. This fact, however, does not indicate that most chickens are immune to the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome, since__. \n Question: Which of the following most logically completes the argument? \n Option0: resistance to some infectious organisms such as the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome can be acquired by exposure to a closely related infectious organism \n Option1: chickens and cattle take more than a year to show symptoms of Ferber's syndrome, and chickens commercially raised for meat, unlike cattle, are generally brought to market during the first year of life \n Option2: the type of feed liable to be infected with the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome generally constitutes a larger proportion of the diet of commercially raised chickens than of commercially raised cattle \n Option3: Ferber's syndrome has been found in animals that have not been fed the type of feed liable to be contaminated with the virus that can cause the disease \n Answer: If it takes more than a year to show symptoms and chickens are generally killed within a year of being born, then chickens will generally never reach an age where they show symptoms, which would explain the rarity of Ferber's syndrome being observed in chickens. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Many people change their wills on their own every few years, in response to significant changes in their personal or financial circumstances. This practice can create a problem for the executor when these people are careless and do not date their wills: the executor will then often know neither which one of several undated wills is the most recent, nor whether the will drawn up last has ever been found. Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. \n Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument \n Option0: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause \n Option1: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution \n Option2: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem \n Option3: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have \n Answer: Dating the will would solve the problem of determining it's relative recency, but would not establish whether or not the most recent will had been found, contrary to the claim made by the argument. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Editorial: Almost every year the Smithfield River floods the coastal fishing community of Redhook, which annually spends $3 million on the cleanup. Some residents have proposed damming the river, which would cost $5 million but would prevent the flooding. However, their position is misguided. A dam would prevent nutrients in the river from flowing into the ocean. Fish that now feed on those nutrients would start feeding elsewhere. The loss of these fish would cost Redhook $10 million annually. \n Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the editorial's argument? \n Option0: The Smithfield River should be dammed to prevent flooding. \n Option1: Nutrients from the Smithfield River are essential to the local fish population. \n Option2: For Redhook to build a dam on the Smithfield River would be a mistake. \n Option3: The Smithfield River floods cost Redhook $3 million every year. \n Answer: The author argues that while damming the river may save money in some ways, it will cost more money when accounting for other factors and is therefore not the right thing to do. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: After an area has been hit by a natural disaster, there is often a great demand for plywood for repairing damaged homes. Retailers in the area often raise prices on new shipments of plywood to well above their predisaster prices, and some people denounce these retailers for taking advantage of a disaster to make more money on each sheet of plywood they sell. In fact, however, these retailers do not make more money on each sheet of plywood than before the disaster, because transporting the plywood into devastated areas is difficult and expensive, and ttherefore the plywood' s cost to retailers is higher than it was before the disaster. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? \n Option0: The increase in the prices charged by retailers for plywood following a natural disaster does not exceed the increase in cost to those retailers. \n Option1: Suppliers of plywood do not transport as much plywood to an area after it has been affected by a natural disaster as they did before it was so affected. \n Option2: Retailers must pay the full amount of any increase in shipping costs. \n Option3: No retailer makes enough money on each sheet of plywood sold to absorb for long an increase in shipping costs without raising prices. \n Answer: The argument hinges on the idea that raising costs of plywood is not actually making more money than predisaster levels, if the increase prices exceeds the cost too much, it would imply the retailers are making more profits and make contradict the argument. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n "]}}, {"name": "cot_incorrect", "prompt": {"context": [["Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income.

But pharmacists have a financial interest in having a monopoly on the sale of prescription medicines, so their objection to the sale of medicines by doctors cannot be taken seriously. \n Question: The patient's argument proceeds by \n Option0: attempting to discredit a position by questioning the motives of the proponents of that position \n Option1: rejecting a questionable position on the grounds that the general public does not support that position \n Option2: pointing out an unstated assumption on which the pharmacists' argument relies and then refuting it \n Option3: asserting that pharmacists lack the appropriate knowledge to have informed opinions on the subject under discussion \n Answer: For Option0, The patient correctly highlights that the pharmacists position also has a potential conflict of interest just like those of the doctors. For Option1, The patient does not invoke public opinion in their argument but instead highlights the incentive structure which introduces conflicts for pharmacists and doctors.  For Option2, There are no unstated assumptions in the argument, but rather the conflict of interest for pharmacists and doctors are clearly pointed out. For Option3, Lack of pharmacists' knowledge was not highlighted in the argument against putting them in charge of prescriptions.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1, 000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier. \n Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage? \n Option0: Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950. \n Option1: As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases. \n Option2: If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline. \n Option3: The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury. \n Answer: For Option0, This was stated as the first statement that ski injuries have dropped in percentage over that time.  For Option1, It just says the percentage increases not the total amount.  For Option2, This cannot be assumed because there will be a point in which this relationship will peak.  For Option3, The passage groups all injuries together so this is impossible to know.   Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: H. G Wells' s great dramatic novel The Time Machine is classified as science fiction simply because it takes place in the future. But this classification is inappropriate because Wells' s book possesses something that great dramatic novels have and science fiction generally lacks -- compelling characters that enable the reader to become absorbed in their plight and not just in the author' s representation of the future of technology. \n Question: The argument's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: All novels that contain compelling characters are great dramatic novels. \n Option1: Novels can always be clearly classified into distinct genres. \n Option2: A dramatic novel cannot both be great and belong to the genre of science fiction. \n Option3: A work of science fiction cannot achieve greatness unless it contains compelling characters. \n Answer: For Option0, The author states comparatively that a particular book which,  has the trait of compelling characters, automatically qualifies, to be a member of a particular book category.  For Option1, The author concludes that every novel book being classified, always cleanly fits into a specific genre of book, tidily.  For Option2, The author states that because a particular genre of book category, generally does not have a subjective trait of compelling characters, that a book classified in said category, cannot be a member of said category, science fiction, because this book does indeed have compelling characters.  For Option3, The author concludes that a specific object/book can only qualify for a level of quality (i.e. greatness) if and only if a particular subjective trait, \"compelling characters\" - are present in the specific object/book.   Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Doctors in Britain have long suspected that patients who wear tinted eyeglasses are abnormally prone to depression and hypochondria. Psychological tests given there to hospital patients admitted for physical complaints like heart pain and digestive distress confirmed such a relationship. Perhaps people whose relationship to the world is psychologically painful choose such glasses to reduce visual stimulation, which is perceived as irritating. At any rate, it can be concluded that when such glasses are worn, it is because the wearer has a tendency to be depressed or hypochondriacal. \n Question: The argument assumes which one of the following? \n Option0: For hypochondriacs wearing tinted glasses, the glasses serve as a visual signal to others that the wearer's health is delicate. \n Option1: Depression is not caused in some cases by an organic condition of the body. \n Option2: The tinting does not dim light to the eye enough to depress the wearer's mood substantially. \n Option3: Wearers do not think of the tinted glasses as a means of distancing themselves from other people. \n Answer: For Option0, Neither the wearer nor others is necessarily aware of the relationship between glasses and health. For Option1, The argument does not speculate on the causes of depression nor rely upon any assumed causes to reach its conclusion. For Option2, The argument assumes that the wearer chooses tinted glasses because they are depressed, and thus assumes that the tinting does not cause the condition itself. For Option3, The argument comes closer to assuming that wearers do think of the glasses as a means of distancing, though they may not be aware of it.

By using JTE, you can eliminate the pests in your yard and keep the rabbits and birds. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? \n Option0: JTE pesticide will not harm the underground water supply. \n Option1: JTE has met all state and federal environmental standards. \n Option2: The rabbits, birds, or other small animals are not in your yard because of the pests. \n Option3: The effectiveness of JTE pesticide does not depend on the strict adherence to specific application procedures. \n Answer: For Option0, The argument is in no way suggesting or making an assumption regarding the water supply.  The argument does not depend on the status of the water. For Option1, The argument does not make an assumption or depend on whether or not the pesticide is approved by state or federal standards. For Option2, This is true because if it is saying it will kill all of the pests but you will still be able to keep the birds and rabbits than they do not need to pests in order to be in your yard. For Option3, The argument does not focus on what the application procedures are only discussing that it will kill pests and help you keep other animals.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: Teachers should not do anything to cause their students to lose respect for them. And students can sense when someone is trying to hide his or her ignorance. Ttherefore, a teacher who does not know the answer to a question a student has asked should not pretend to know the answer. \n Question: The conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: Students respect honesty above all else. \n Option1: Students lose respect for teachers whenever they sense that the teachers are trying to hide their ignorance. \n Option2: Students' respect for a teacher is independent of the amount of knowledge they attribute to that teacher. \n Option3: A teacher cannot be effective unless he or she retains the respect of students. \n Answer: For Option0, The ranking of students' respect for honesty is not relevant to the conclusion of a teacher shouldn't pretend to know an answer to question they don't know the answer to. For Option1, The assumption is that students' respect for the teacher is based on how much knowledge the teacher has.  For Option2, The conclusion is that teachers shouldn't pretend to know the answer to a question that they don't know, so the assumption is that student's respect for a teacher is interlinked to the student's perceived knowledge of the teacher. For Option3, The conclusion does not have anything to do with a teacher being effective.  Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Miguel has four family members who plan to come to his graduation on Sunday afternoon, but it is likely that only three of them will be allowed to attend. Normally graduation is held in the football stadium, where there is no limit on the number of family members who can attend. However, the ceremony is relocated to the gymnasium if it rains, and each graduate receives just three admission tickets for use by family members. \n Question: The conclusion of the argument is most strongly supported if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: Miguel has several friends who have fewer than three family members coming to graduation. \n Option1: Miguel's graduating class is much larger than usual. \n Option2: Miguel has a fifth family member who is unable to come to his graduation. \n Option3: The weather service has indicated that there is a very high likelihood of rain on Sunday afternoon. \n Answer: For Option0, No mention is made of whether un-needed spaces can be transferred between students, and so this cannot be assumed to impact the number of spaces available to Miguel's family. For Option1, Abnormally large class size may not preclude Miguel from having more than three family members attend, as the football stadium is a possible venue and has no limitation on the number who may attend.  For Option2, A family member who cannot attend the graduation has no relevance to how many may be allowed to attend.  For Option3, Rain would preclude the use of the stadium which has no limit of the number of family members attending and force the use of the gymnasium, which limits the number attending to three.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Food company engineer: I stand by my decision to order the dumping of small amounts of chemicals into the local river even though there is some evidence that this material may pose health problems. 1 fish in the river myself and will continue to do so. Furthermore, I will have no problem if other food manufacturers do what our company does. \n Question: The engineer's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? \n Option0: One is justified in performing an act if one is willing to submit oneself to the consequences of that action performed by oneself or others. \n Option1: One should always choose to act in a way that will benefit the greatest number of people. \n Option2: One is justified in performing an act if other people are also planning to perform that kind of act. \n Option3: One should never perform an act until one has fully analyzed all the ways in which that act could impact others. \n Answer: For Option0, The engineer says they themselves fish in the river and will continue to do so despite his dumping. For Option1, the greatest number of people would be benefited by no dumping in the river. For Option2, The engineer made the decision to dump in the river prior to others and states they don't mind if others do as well. For Option3, The engineer states they see nothing wrong with it and will continue to dump in the river as well as to fish there.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: Counselor: Those who believe that criticism should be gentle rather than harsh should consider the following: change requires a motive, and criticism that is unpleasant provides a motive. Since harsh criticism is unpleasant, harsh criticism provides a motive. Ttherefore, only harsh criticism will cause the person criticized to change. \n Question: The reasoning in the counselor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument \n Option0: fails to address the possibility that in some cases the primary goal of criticism is something other than bringing about change in the person being criticized \n Option1: takes for granted that everyone who is motivated to change will change \n Option2: infers that something that is sufficient to provide a motive is necessary to provide a motive \n Option3: confuses a motive for doing something with a motive for avoiding something \n Answer: For Option0, Criticism is utilized to express unhappiness with the way an individual is performing, and to get them to change. For Option1, If a person is truly motivated, one will see changes in their behavior over time. For Option2, Although harsh criticism does indeed work in order to cause change, it is not the only strategy that has been used to implement change in others. For Option3, The motive for avoiding harsh criticism will work just as well as the motive to do better at a task.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Like airplane accidents, most accidents in medical care result from human error, particularly failures in communication, leadership, and decision making. Following the introduction of standard procedures governing these three areas, the airline industry succeeded in significantly reducing the number and severity of accidents. Since airplane flights and health care delivery both require the cooperation of groups of people with diverse knowledge and skills, the medical care community should adopt a similar set of procedures in order to reduce errors. \n Question: Which one of the following is a technique of reasoning used in the argument? \n Option0: providing examples in order to show that two seemingly dissimilar situations are in fact the same \n Option1: defending a general principle by presenting two separate successful applications of that principle \n Option2: arguing for taking a course of action based on results of taking such action in an analogous situation \n Option3: justifying the introduction of a set of procedures by outlining undesirable results in an analogous situation in which those procedures were not followed \n Answer: For Option0, The passage is just not comparing the two situations but showing that the skills required in one are similar to that of the other and that training could be helpful in the solutions that worked for one in the second one. For Option1, I think it was showing the successful application in one and how it could be used in the second. For Option2, The passage is stating that the airplane and healthcare industries face similar accident and that the action of one being successful could be succesful in the other. For Option3, I think it was more focused on the desirable results that could be found by enacting these procedures.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: Ten years ago, the Salisbury City Council passed the Culinary Bill, new legislation to protect the interests of local non-franchise restaurants. Of the 120 local non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury today, 85 opened during the last ten years. Clearly the Culinary Bill has caused a surge in the number of local non-franchise restaurants operating in Salisbury over the past ten years. \n Question: Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? \n Option0: All economic indicators suggest that household incomes in Salisbury have risen substantially over the past ten years. \n Option1: The Culinary Bill provides no benefit to restaurants that are members of national franchise chains \n Option2: Most of the consumers in Salisbury who patronize these local restaurants are aware of the provisions of the Culinary Bill and approve of them. \n Option3: Of the local non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury ten years ago, fewer than 85 have closed. \n Answer: For Option0, The passage makes no mention of household incomes in Salisbury and only focuses upon the Culinary Bill and the amount of restaurants that remain open today.  For Option1, The bills is stated to have been created to protect the interests of non-franchise restaurants as well as being stated to have caused a surge in the number of non-franchise restaurants in the city.  For Option2, We have no knowledge from the passage as to whether or not patrons are aware of the Bill and its intentions or not. Assuming the patrons are or are not informed would be erroneous.  For Option3, The passage tells us that there are 120 non-franchise restaurants in Salisbury and that of those 120 restaurants 85 opened in the last ten years.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: In polluted industrial English cities during the Industrial Revolution, two plant diseases -- black spot, which infects roses, and tar spot, which infects sycamore trees -- disappeared. It is likely that air pollution eradicated these diseases. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the reasoning above? \n Option0: Scientists theorize that some plants can develop a resistance to air pollution. \n Option1: Black spot and tar spot returned when the air in the cities became less polluted. \n Option2: For many plant species, scientists have not determined the effects of air pollution. \n Option3: Black spot and tar spot were the only plant diseases that disappeared in any English cities during the Industrial Revolution. \n Answer: For Option0, Plants building up a resistance to air pollution would not impact air pollution's effect on diseases. For Option1, The author stated that it is likely that air pollution eradicated these diseases, so a lack of air pollution would bring the diseases back. For Option2, The effects of air pollution on plants wasn't being discussed, it was the effects of air pollution on diseases. For Option3, The author stated that these two diseases disappeared, but attributed it specifically to the increased air pollution.  Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: Editorial: It is clear that if this country' s universities were living up to both their moral and their intellectual responsibilities, the best-selling publications in most university bookstores would not be frivolous ones like TV Today and Gossip Review. However, in most university bookstores the only publication that sells better than Gossip Review is TV Today. \n Question: If the statements in the editorial are true, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of them? \n Option0: At least some of this country's universities are not meeting their moral responsibilities or their intellectual responsibilities or both. \n Option1: People who purchase publications that are devoted primarily to gossip or to television programming are intellectually irresponsible. \n Option2: Many people who attend this country's universities fail to live up to both their moral and their intellectual responsibilities. \n Option3: It is irresponsible for university bookstores to carry publications such as Gossip Review and TV Today. \n Answer: For Option0, The best-selling publications in university bookstores are frivolous ones like TV Today and Gossip Review, so based on the editorial, this country's universities cannot be living up to both their moral and intellectual responsibilities. For Option1, The editorial makes a claim about the intellectual responsibility of universities, but says nothing about the intellectual responsibility of individuals who purchase specific publications. For Option2, The editorial makes a claim about the moral and intellectual responsibilities of universities, but says nothing about the moral and intellectual responsibilities of individuals who attend these universities. For Option3, The editorial suggests that it is morally and/or intellectually irresponsible for universities to have created a moral and intellectual environment where frivolous publications are the most popular, but it does not make any claims about whether merely carrying such publications is irresponsible.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history, but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons. We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I. \n Question: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? \n Option0: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it. \n Option1: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false. \n Option2: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion. \n Option3: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting. \n Answer: For Option0, The author argues that it is not possible to learn the lessons of history, that we should learn the lessons of history is only compatible with denying this.  For Option1, The author does not take this position for granted but gives specific reasons they disagree with it.  For Option2, The author's conclusions are contrary to the assumption that we should learn the lessons of history.  For Option3, The position that we should learn the lessons of history is argued against in specific ways by the author.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: A reason Larson cannot do the assignment is that she has an unavoidable scheduling conflict. On the other hand, a reason Franks cannot do the assignment is that he does not quite have the assertiveness the task requires. So, the task must be assigned to Parker, the only supervisor in the shipping department other than Larson and Franks. \n Question: The argument depends on assuming which one of the following? \n Option0: Franks would be assigned the task if Franks had the assertiveness the task requires. \n Option1: Larson has the assertiveness the task requires. \n Option2: The task cannot be assigned to anyone who has any kind of scheduling conflict. \n Option3: The task cannot be assigned to anyone other than a supervisor in the shipping department. \n Answer: For Option0, Whether not Franks was assigned the task if Franks had the assertiveness is not important to the argument that the task must be assigned to a supervisor in the shipping department.  For Option1, The claim that Larson has the assertiveness the task requires is not important to the argument that the ask must be assigned to a supervisor in the shipping department.  For Option2, A person is excluded because of an unavoidable scheduling conflict, it's possible that the task could be assigned to people with other kinds of scheduling conflicts.  For Option3, The argument states that the task must be given to the only supervisor left who can do it but if the task could be assigned to a person who is not a supervisor there could be more options for who to assign it to.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n", "Context: City council member: Despite the city' s desperate need to exploit any available source of revenue, the mayor has repeatedly blocked council members' attempts to pass legislation imposing real estate development fees. It is clear that in doing so the mayor is sacrificing the city' s interests to personal interests. The mayor cites figures to show that, in the current market, fees of the size proposed would significantly reduce the number of building starts and thus, on balance, result in a revenue loss to the city. But the important point is that the mayor' s family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter. \n Question: Which one of the following most accurately and completely expresses the main conclusion of the city council member's argument? \n Option0: Significantly reducing the number of building starts would not, on balance, result in revenue loss to the city. \n Option1: Imposing real estate development fees is the best way for the city to exploit the available sources of revenue. \n Option2: The mayor's family has a strong financial interest in preventing the passage of legislation that would impose real estate development fees. \n Option3: In blocking council members' attempts to impose real estate development fees, the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests. \n Answer: For Option0, The argument does not directly address whether the mayor's advancement of the contrary argument regarding the effect of reduced building starts is correct or not.  For Option1, The argument mentions no other methods of exploiting sources of revenue and so does not address the relative importance of development fees.  For Option2, Financial interests by the mayor's family are asserted, but they are not the argument's main conclusion.  For Option3, The argument concludes that the mayor's reluctance to impose development fees is due to his and his family's personal financial interest in the matter, due to them being impacted by such fees.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Many people change their wills on their own every few years, in response to significant changes in their personal or financial circumstances. This practice can create a problem for the executor when these people are careless and do not date their wills: the executor will then often know neither which one of several undated wills is the most recent, nor whether the will drawn up last has ever been found. Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. \n Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument \n Option0: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause \n Option1: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution \n Option2: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem \n Option3: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have \n Answer: For Option0, The argument makes no mention of containing adverse effects, merely enumerating two of them.  For Option1, Dating the will would solve the problem of determining it's relative recency, but would not establish whether or not the most recent will had been found, contrary to the claim made by the argument.  For Option2, The proposed solution of will dating does in fact solve one aspect of the problem (relative recency of wills), and makes no mention of any other parties being involved.  For Option3, The hypothetical existence of unspecified negative consequences of any action does not by itself invalidate reasoning based on that action.  Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: In the paintings by seventeenth-century Dutch artist Vermeer, we find several recurrent items: a satin jacket, a certain Turkish carpet, and wooden chairs with lion' s head finials. These reappearing objects might seem to evince a dearth of props. Yet we know that many of the props Vermeer used were expensive. Thus, while we might speculate about exactly why Vermeer worked with a small number of familiar objects, it was clearly not for lack of props that the recurrent items were used. \n Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n Option0: If a dearth of props accounted for the recurrent objects in Vermeer's paintings, we would not see expensive props in any of them. \n Option1: The props that recur in Vermeer's paintings were always available to him. \n Option2: The satin jacket and wooden chairs that recur in the paintings were owned by Vermeer's sister. \n Option3: The several recurrent items that appeared in Vermeer's paintings had special sentimental importance for him. \n Answer: For Option0, If Vermeer could afford to purchase the expensive items that are seen as props in his works, then he could certainly afford to purchase many inexpensive props as well. For Option1, Any props that were in Vermeer's studio would have been available for him to use, not just the ones seen in his paintings. For Option2, If the satin jacket and wooden chairs in Vermeer's paintings were owned by his sister, then perhaps he couldn't afford to purchase props and had to borrow them. For Option3, If Vermeer was constantly including sentimental items in his paintings, then one could not assume that he didn't also own a lot of props that were not as important to him.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: According to a prediction of the not-so-distant future published in 1940, electricity would revolutionize agriculture. Electrodes would be inserted into the soil, and the current between them would kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger. \n Question: Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed? \n Option0: In order for farmers to avoid electric shock while working in the fields, the current could be turned off at such times without diminishing the intended effects. \n Option1: Because a planting machine would need to avoid coming into contact with the electrodes, new parts for planting machines would need to be designed. \n Option2: It cannot be taken for granted that the use of electricity is always beneficial. \n Option3: Since weeds are plants, electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants. \n Answer: For Option0, This would support the prediction because it would take potential farmer or human injury or death out of the equation and make the prediction safer and easier to come true.  For Option1, This also supports the prediction because it answers the question or concern as to how the planting machine and the electrodes would be able to safely interact and come into contact with one another. New parts would be designed to make this possible and safe.  For Option2, This point does not support the prediction because it tells us that perhaps electricity is not always helpful and could cause problems in a prediction such as this.  For Option3, This shows a great flaw in the prediction and logo because weeds and crops are both types of plants and no explanation as to how the machine would know the difference between types of plants is given in the prediction.   Therefore the answer is Option3 \n Context: Most people are indignant at the suggestion that they are not reliable authorities about their real wants. Such self-knowledge, however, is not the easiest kind of knowledge to acquire. Indeed, acquiring it often requires hard and even potentially risky work. To avoid such effort, people unconsciously convince themselves that they want what society says they should want. \n Question: The main point of the argument is that \n Option0: people cannot really want what they should want \n Option1: knowledge of what one really wants is not as desirable as it is usually thought to be \n Option2: people are not necessarily reliable authorities about what they really want \n Option3: people usually avoid making difficult decisions \n Answer: For Option0, The argument does not make any claims about what people should want, only that people unconsciously align their wants with what society believes they should want. For Option1, The argument claims that knowledge of what one really wants is difficult to achieve, but it does not make any judgment on how desirable this knowledge is. For Option2, The argument says that people avoid the effort of actually understanding their real wants, so it follows logically that people are not necessarily reliable authorities about what they really want. For Option3, The argument discusses people's avoidance of putting in effort to understand their real wants, but not avoidance of making difficult decisions.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n", "Context: When a group of people starts a company, the founders usually serve as sources both of funding and of skills in marketing, management, and technical matters. It is unlikely that a single individual can both provide adequate funding and be skilled in marketing, management, and technical matters. Ttherefore, companies founded by groups are more likely to succeed than companies founded by individuals. \n Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? \n Option0: Some founding members of successful companies can provide both funding and skills in marketing, management, or technical matters. \n Option1: Founders of a new company can more easily acquire marketing and management abilities than technical abilities. \n Option2: New companies are more likely to succeed when their founders can provide adequate funding and skills in marketing, management, and technical abilities than if they must secure funding or skills from nonfounders. \n Option3: A new company is more likely to succeed if every founding member contributes equally to the company's initial funding than if some members contribute more funds than others. \n Answer: For Option0, The argument assumes that it is unlikely that an individual would have all of these skills. For Option1, The argument is not concerned with who can more easily acquire these abilities. For Option2, The argument states that these skills are important when starting a new company. For Option3, The argument is concerned with the overall skills and contributions of the company not how these skills are provided.  Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Trustee: The recent exhibit at the art museum was extensively covered by the local media, and this coverage seems to have contributed to the record-breaking attendance it drew. If the attendance at the exhibit had been low, the museum would have gone bankrupt and closed permanently, so the museum could not have remained open had it not been for the coverage from the local media. \n Question: The reasoning in the trustee's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument \n Option0: presupposes the very conclusion that it is trying to prove \n Option1: takes for granted that most people who read articles about the exhibit also attended the exhibit \n Option2: fails to address the possibility that the exhibit would have drawn enough visitors to prevent bankruptcy even without media coverage \n Option3: takes for granted that no previous exhibit at the museum had received such extensive media coverage \n Answer: For Option0, The media covered it does not necessarily have an impact in all situations so the conclusion could not have been presupposed.  For Option1, The passage does not mention any other media.  For Option2, This is perfect causation without correlation. There is no way to know whether there would have been many attendees, there is no control group.  For Option3, It does not matter what another exhibit has done in the past.   Therefore the answer is Option2 \n Context: Undoubtedly, one' s freedom is always worth the risk of losing one' s life. Consider a person who is locked in a bare cement room with no hope of escape. This person is not really living and has nothing to lose. \n Question: A flaw in the argument's reasoning is that the argument \n Option0: generalizes inappropriately from a single extreme case to a universal claim \n Option1: presumes, without providing justification, that nothing can have greater value than one's own freedom \n Option2: fails to consider that it is not always possible to rebel physically against an encroachment on one's freedom \n Option3: fails to establish that the freedom of others is worth taking risks for \n Answer: For Option0, It isn't taking into account more realistic events that one faces.  It is presenting you with a solely life or death situation. For Option1, It is showing you an example of how not living  is a reason to take a chance. For Option2, It is telling you that the opportunity is there whether or not it is attainable. For Option3, It is focusing more on the freedom of oneself versus the freedom of others.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n Context: The traditional view of the Roman emperor Caligula as a cruel and insane tyrant has been challenged by some modern historians. They point out that little documentation of Caligula' s alleged cruelty or outrageous behavior survives from the time of his reign and that the histories that have come down to us were written by his enemies. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the challenge from the modem historians? \n Option0: People who have lived under someone regarded as a cruel tyrant are more likely to view that person unfavorably than favorably. \n Option1: The specific outrageous acts attributed to Caligula in Roman documentation are very similar to acts attributed in earlier writings to other rulers alleged to be cruel tyrants. \n Option2: There is less documentation of any sort from Caligula's reign than from the reigns of most other Roman emperors of Caligula's era. \n Option3: There is ample documentation of modern tyrants being responsible for outrageous acts worse than those attributed to Caligula. \n Answer: For Option0, The passage mentions that the bad things written about Caligula were by his enemies, it never mentions people that he was cruel to.  For Option1, This just shows that rulers of this time had a certain standard and Caligula was no more cruel than anyone else.  For Option2, The passage does not mention that there was a scarcity of documents.  For Option3, The passage does not mention if modern tyrants are more cruel or not.   Therefore the answer is Option1 \n Context: In Country X' s last election, the Reform Party beat its main opponent, the Conservative Party, although pollsters, employing in-person interviews shortly before the vote, had projected a Conservative Party victory. Afterwards, the pollsters determined that, unlike Conservative Party supporters, Reform Party supporters were less likely to express their party preference during in-person interviews than they were during telephone interviews. Ttherefore, using only telephone interviews instead would likely result in more accurate projections for the next election. \n Question: Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the argument in the passage? \n Option0: For each person interviewed in telephone polls before the next election, pollsters will be able to reasonably determine the likelihood of that person voting. \n Option1: In the next election, pollsters will be able to conduct more in-person interviews than telephone interviews. \n Option2: The number of voters in Country X's next election will be significantly larger than the number of voters in the last election. \n Option3: The Conservative Party will win the next election. \n Answer: For Option0, In order for the party preferences of people interviewed by telephone to matter, it must be known about how many of them will actually vote. For Option1, The quantity of different types of interviews has no bearing on which methodology is more accurate. For Option2, The size of the voting base has nothing to do with the accuracy of voting projections. For Option3, What brought the projections into question to begin with was that the Conservative Party lost, so them winning would do nothing to support the argument.  Therefore the answer is Option0 \n"]}}], "1shot": [{"name": "vanilla", "prompt": {"context": [["Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income.

This led those in charge of the attraction to hypothesize that visitors were illicitly selling or sharing the passes. \n Question: Each of the following, if true, helps to undermine the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction EXCEPT: \n Option0: During the past year other tourist attractions have opened up in the area. \n Option1: While the cost of passes is unchanged since last year, hotel and meal prices have risen. \n Option2: The local board of tourism reports that the average length of stay for tourists remained unchanged over the past year. \n Option3: Those possessing passes made more frequent trips to the attraction last year than in previous years. \n Answer: If this was true, it would not undermine the hypothesis of those in charge of the tourist attraction, because it would mean that the increased revenues of the hotel and restaurant industries are NOT due to tourists taking longer vacations (thus paying more for lodging, meals, etc.). Therefore, there must still be some other reason that hotel/restaurant revenues are increasingly more rapidly than the revenue of the tourist attraction, leaving the illegal selling/sharing of passes as a possibility. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n ", "Context: MetroBank made loans to ten small companies, in amounts ranging from $1, 000 to $100, 000. These ten loans all had graduated payment plans, i. e. , the scheduled monthly loan payment increased slightly each month over the five-year term of the loan. Nonetheless, the average payment received by MetroBank for these ten loans had decreased by the end of the five-year term. \n Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the statements above? \n Option0: Of the ten small companies, the three that had borrowed the largest amounts paid off their loans within three years. \n Option1: For some loans made by MetroBank, the monthly payment decreases slightly over the term of the loan. \n Option2: The number of small companies receiving new loans from MetroBank increased over the five-year term. \n Option3: Most banks offer a greater number of loans for under $100, 000 than for over $100, 000. \n Answer: If, on a graduated payment plan, then the payments increase over the life of the loan. As payments increase, the average received would increase. The only way it would decrease is if the number of loans decreased. Since the largest amounts would have the largest payments, they would affect the average more than a small amount. Therefore the answer is Option0 \n ", "Context: Creating a database of all the plant species in the scientific record has proved to be no easy task. For centuries, botanists have been collecting and naming plants without realizing that many were in fact already named. And by using DNA analysis, botanists have shown that varieties of plants long thought to belong to the same species actually belong to different species. \n Question: Of the following claims, which one can most justifiably be rejected on the basis of the statements above? \n Option0: Duplicates and omissions in the scientific record also occur in fields other than botany. \n Option1: Botanists have no techniques for determining whether distinct plant species have been given distinct names. \n Option2: A person who consults the scientific record looking under only one of a plant's names may miss available information about that plant. \n Option3: Most of the duplicates and omissions among plant names in the scientific record have yet to be cleared up. \n Answer: If there were no methods for determining whether or not distinct plant species have been given distinct names, botanists would not be able to see that some plants previously thought to be the same species are not nor would they know there are those being named after having bene previously. Therefore the answer is Option1 \n ", "Context: Legal commentator: The goal of a recently enacted law that bans smoking in workplaces is to protect employees from secondhand smoke. But the law is written in such a way that it cannot be interpreted as ever prohibiting people from smoking in their own homes. \n Question: The statements above, if true, provide a basis for rejecting which one of the following claims? \n Option0: Most people believe that smokers have a fundamental right to smoke in their own homes. \n Option1: The law offers no protection from secondhand smoke for people outside of their workplaces. \n Option2: The law will protect domestic workers such as housecleaners from secondhand smoke in their workplaces. \n Option3: Supporters of the law believe that it will have a significant impact on the health of many workers. \n Answer: This is not supported because the passage states that the law cannot be interpreted as prohibiting people from smoking in their own homes.  This would not protect domestic workers from secondhand smoke in their workplaces because the people who live in the homes they are working at would be allowed to smoke. Therefore the answer is Option2 \n ", "Context: All known living things are made of the same basic kinds of matter, are carbon based, and are equipped with genetic codes.
